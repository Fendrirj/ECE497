This directory hold the mmap homework assignment.

Under the mmap directory you will find two programs and one shell script. Before running either program, make sure you run the shell script first. Then, to run a program, simply call it (Make sure you have button wired to pins 30 and 60 and an LED wired to pin 31). There are no arguments which need to be passed to either program.
